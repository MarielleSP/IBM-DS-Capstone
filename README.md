# Rate-Neighborhoods


## Introduction
This project will use location data from Foursquare on what types of businesses and services are located within a given radius from a given location (address or latitude plus longitude). Based on their preferences of the user (e.g. proximity to dog park, school district, etc.), a neighborhood rating will be generated.
